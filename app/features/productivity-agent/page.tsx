      <hr />

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>
        Our AI agent analyzes your work patterns, task complexity, and productivity rhythms to provide
        personalized recommendations. It's like having a dedicated productivity coach that's available 24/7.
      </p>

      <h3>Intelligent Task Management</h3>
      <p>
        Simply describe your goals in natural language, and the agent breaks them down into manageable tasks.
        It understands context, priorities, and deadlines, automatically organizing your work in the most
        effective sequence.
      </p>

      <h3>Adaptive Planning</h3>
      <p>
        The agent learns from your completion patterns and adjusts future planning accordingly. If you
        consistently underestimate certain types of tasks, it will factor that into future suggestions.
      </p>

      <h3>Personalized Insights</h3>
      <p>
        Get detailed insights about your productivity patterns, energy levels, and optimal work times.
        The agent identifies trends and suggests improvements to help you work more efficiently.
