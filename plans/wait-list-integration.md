# Complete Convex Waitlist Integration Guide

The Convex waitlist system is a production-ready solution designed to protect web applications from traffic surges by implementing intelligent queue management. **This system can handle tens of thousands of users per hour while maintaining minimal infrastructure costs**, making it perfect for high-demand product launches like Pomotea.

The integration process involves three main components: backend Convex setup with real-time database functions, frontend React components with TypeScript support, and seamless Next.js integration with your existing modal architecture. The system uses position-based queuing with real-time updates, ensuring users receive immediate feedback about their queue status and estimated wait times.

## Backend setup with Convex database and functions

The Convex backend requires specific database tables and serverless functions to manage waitlist sessions effectively. **The schema uses two optimized tables: a sessions table for tracking individual users and a counter table for performance optimization**.

The core database schema includes a sessions table with fields for `sessionId`, `status` (waiting/active), `position`, and `lastActive` timestamp. An additional counter table maintains cached active session counts to avoid expensive real-time counting operations. These tables use strategic indexing on sessionId, status, and position fields for optimal query performance.

Create the schema by copying the waitlist folder from the repository into your `convex` directory, then update your `convex/schema.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineSchema } from "convex/server";
import { waitlistTables } from "./waitlist/schema";

export default defineSchema({
  ...waitlistTables,
  // your other tables
});
```

The backend functions include query operations for checking session status and validation, mutation functions for creating sessions and refreshing activity, and scheduled cron jobs for periodic cleanup. **The system uses a global position increment strategy rather than real-time counting**, significantly improving performance under high load.

Configure essential environment variables in the Convex dashboard:
- `ACTIVE_SESSIONS_COUNT_LIMIT`: Maximum concurrent active users (default: 100)
- `WAITLIST_UPDATE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: Cleanup frequency (default: 60)
- `ACTIVE_SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Active session timeout (default: 300)
- `WAITING_SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Waiting session timeout (default: 60)

## Client-side React components with TypeScript integration

The frontend implementation centers around a main `Waitlist` wrapper component that manages session state and renders appropriate UI based on user status. **The component uses Convex's reactive queries to provide real-time updates without polling**, ensuring users see position changes immediately.

Set up the Convex provider in your Next.js layout:

```typescript
// app/ConvexClientProvider.tsx
"use client";
import { ConvexProvider, ConvexReactClient } from "convex/react";

const convex = new ConvexReactClient(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL!);

export function ConvexClientProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return <ConvexProvider client={convex}>{children}</ConvexProvider>;
}
```

The waitlist signup form component handles user registration with comprehensive validation and error handling. Key features include email validation, name requirements, session ID generation using `crypto.randomUUID()`, and optimistic UI updates. The form integrates seamlessly with your existing Tailwind CSS styling and modal architecture.

For TypeScript support, define interfaces for `WaitlistSession`, `WaitlistStatus`, and `WaitlistSignupData`. The Convex client automatically generates types from your schema, providing end-to-end type safety from database to UI components.

Create a custom hook for form management that handles validation, submission, and error states:

```typescript
export function useWaitlistForm() {
  const [formState, setFormState] = useState<WaitlistFormState>({
    email: "",
    name: "",
    isSubmitting: false,
    error: null,
    success: false,
  });
  
  const joinWaitlist = useMutation(api.waitlist.write.joinWaitlist);
  // validation and submission logic
}
```

## Integration with existing Pomotea modal components

Since your Pomotea landing page already has modal components, the integration focuses on wrapping your existing modal with waitlist functionality rather than replacing it. **The system provides flexible render props that allow complete customization of the waiting experience**.

Your existing modal can be enhanced with the `WaitlistModal` component that handles three states: signup form, waiting status, and success confirmation. The modal integrates with your current Tailwind CSS classes and maintains your existing design system.

```typescript
<WaitlistModal
  trigger={<Button>Join Waitlist</Button>}
  open={isModalOpen}
  onOpenChange={setIsModalOpen}
/>
```

The waitlist status component displays position information with progress indicators and estimated wait times. You can customize the waiting experience by providing a `whileWaiting` render prop that receives position and total waiting count parameters.

For session persistence across browser refreshes, store the session ID in localStorage when users join the waitlist. Implement a session recovery mechanism that checks for existing sessions on page load and automatically restores waitlist status.

## Production deployment and security considerations

Deploy the backend by running `npx convex deploy` for production. **Configure your deployment environment variables in the Convex dashboard rather than using local files**, ensuring proper security for production secrets.

The system includes built-in security features: input validation using Convex's argument validators, rate limiting protection against excessive session creation, and session validation for all protected endpoints. For authenticated applications, integrate with Clerk or Auth0 using `ConvexProviderWithClerk` instead of the standard provider.

Implement error boundaries around waitlist components to handle connection issues gracefully. Use the connection state hook to display offline indicators and automatic reconnection messages. **The system maintains WebSocket connections for real-time updates but gracefully degrades to polling if WebSocket connections fail**.

Monitor performance using Convex's built-in analytics dashboard, which tracks function execution times, database query performance, and active connection counts. Set up alerts for unusual traffic patterns or error rates to ensure smooth operation during high-demand periods.

## Advanced configuration and optimization

The waitlist system supports extensive customization through configuration variables and component props. **Adjust session timeouts based on your application's usage patterns** - shorter timeouts for high-velocity signups, longer timeouts for applications where users spend more time active.

For applications expecting very high traffic, consider implementing geographic distribution by configuring multiple Convex deployments across regions. The system's stateless design makes horizontal scaling straightforward.

Customize the user experience with branded waiting screens, estimated wait time calculations, and personalized messaging based on user position. The flexible component architecture allows complete styling freedom while maintaining the underlying queue management logic.

## Conclusion

The Convex waitlist integration provides a robust, scalable solution for managing user access during high-demand periods. The system's reactive architecture ensures real-time updates, while the optimized database design handles massive concurrent users efficiently. **By implementing position-based queuing with intelligent caching, the system maintains excellent performance while providing users with transparent, real-time feedback about their queue status**.

The integration with your existing Next.js and Tailwind CSS setup requires minimal changes to your current architecture, making it an ideal solution for adding waitlist functionality to the Pomotea landing page without disrupting your existing user experience or design system.
