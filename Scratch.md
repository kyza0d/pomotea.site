# Why I Built Pomotea: A Tool for Finding Flow

I’ve always struggled to stay focused. Like many of you, I’d start my day with ambitious plans, only to be derailed by notifications, scattered to-do lists, or overwhelming workloads. I tried countless productivity apps, but they felt rigid, like taskmasters that didn’t understand how I work. Frustrated, I built *Pomotea*—a tool designed not just to check boxes, but to help you find *flow*, that effortless state where work feels natural and time slips away.

## The Philosophy Behind Pomotea
Pomotea is built on a few core principles that reflect my vision for meaningful productivity:

- **Focus on Flow, Not Just Output**: Productivity for its own sake isn’t the goal. Flow—being fully immersed in your work, is where creativity and progress thrive. Pomotea is crafted to guide you into that state.
- **Minimize Context Switching**: Constantly jumping between tasks saps your energy. Pomotea streamlines your workflow to keep you in the zone, reducing distractions and mental clutter.
- **Deep Customization**: Everyone works differently. Pomotea is flexible, letting you tailor it to your unique style, so it feels like it was made just for you.

## Core Features of Pomotea
Pomotea’s features are designed to make these principles a reality, helping you work smarter and stay focused.

### Flow: Your AI Productivity Companion
At the heart of Pomotea is *Flow*, an AI companion that takes the chaos out of task management. Flow doesn’t wait for you to figure things out—it proactively organizes your tasks, prioritizes what’s urgent, and suggests the best tools to get things done efficiently. Need to schedule a meeting or pull up a document? Flow handles it seamlessly, letting you stay focused on what matters most.

### Session-Based Focus
Inspired by the Pomodoro technique, Pomotea centers around focused work sessions. When you start a session, Pomotea helps you zero in on one task, cutting out distractions and guiding you into flow. It’s not about cramming more into your day—it’s about making every moment count with intentional, distraction-free work.

### Goal-Centric Planning
Pomotea makes it easy to see the big picture without getting lost in the details. You can map out your goals—whether yearly, monthly, or weekly—and break them into manageable steps. Flow connects every task to your larger vision, ensuring that your daily work moves you closer to your dreams.

### Automatic Time Tracking
Understanding how you spend your time is key to improving focus. Pomotea automatically logs time during your sessions, giving you a clear picture of your day. Tell Flow what you worked on—or even admit to getting sidetracked watching videos—and it’ll provide insights to help you reflect and refine your habits. It’s like having a gentle accountability partner by your side.
